Neo4j Browser
=============

*Explore the graph, one query at a time.* 

Neo4j Browser is a stealth project to update Neo4j's built-in client application, a mashup of a REPL, data visualization and lightweight IDE.

*Please* do not share links to this project or discuss it in any public forums.

Goals:

- developer focused
- every interaction is a demonstration
- uses only public APIs
- for modern browsers, with reasonable fallbacks
